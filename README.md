[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/d132c156723f91e45756/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/catks/yellow_number/maintainability)

Yellow Number search's for a contact info (name and telephone number) by address

## Installation

To run you only need to have docker and docker-compose

```bash
git clone https://github.com/catks/yellow_number
cd yellow_number
docker-compose build
```

## Usage

To use create a `input.txt` file in the project directory, and add the addresses you want yellow_number to search.

Example of `input.txt` contents:

```
Rua Legal, 123, SÃ£o Paulo
Rua dos Bobos, 0, Moraes City
```

OBS: Each address must be placed in one line and follow the pattern `street name, number, city`

After that just run the app

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app
```

Yellow number will create a csv file for each address in input.txt and will place it in the output folder.

## TODO

 1. Add docker-entrypoint function to wait for selenium container
 2. Add Search Strategies
 3. Add Integration Tests
 4. Add more output formats
 5. Add a cli interface(to set output and search strategies)
